# Code-Refactor
Homework Week 2
The point of this assignment was to refactor the source code of the example website to use semantic html tags and ensure that the website was assessable, and that the code was legible and descriptive. By changing the <div> tags to <article> tags or <aside> tags where necessary, I was able to preserve the affect of the original source code while ensuring the use of semantic tags.
